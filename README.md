# FarmManager-sbs19016
CCT College - Cloud-Based Web Applications (HDIP 2019 PT) - CA 'Farm Manager' - sbs19016

Lecturer: David Gonzales

This is a CA (continuous assessment work) that I completed for the 'Cloud-Based Web Applications' module, part of the Computer Science lvl 8 course at CCT College. The task was to develop a Spring Boot application to control the livestock of a farm. The system allows do perform POST or GET requests around the benefits of the farm as well as get a summary of the current stocking level of the same.
